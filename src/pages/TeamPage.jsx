In my past year of volunteering with RED, I’ve been excited by RED’s ability to both engage young people in science and get them thinking critically about drug use. Given the current opioid crisis and the recent legalization of cannabis, it’s increasingly important for young people to understand the effects of drugs on the brain, in order to be able to make informed decisions. This year I’m looking forward to helping construct scientific presentations that are both relevant to today’s youth and that will help facilitate a discussion on drug use. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, playing music and downhill skiing.",

As a biomedical sciences student, RED presented the perfect opportunity to unite my academic interests with my passion for advocacy. During my time with RED, I had my first real exposure to teaching in a classroom environment. It was inspiring to see students genuinely engaging with the real-world implications of contentious issues like addiction and the opioid crisis. Last year, we were able to reach over 1000 students at 13 different schools. This year, as VP External, my goals are to see RED expand its presence in Calgary to even more schools, and to lay the groundwork for our expansion to other parts of Alberta.",

Over the years, their habits progressed and drugs became a part of their lifestyle. Witnessing first-hand the impact that substance abuse has on youth has driven me to take a stand and educate a younger audience. My goal and purpose on this team is to make sure that the next generation of students get the opportunity to learn about substance abuse in a way that was not made available to me or my peers. Through engaging presentations and interactive learning, I hope to inform the younger generation about the science, and knowledge of drugs and substances. I would also like to introduce the world of science to youth at a younger age as it is one of the fastest-growing and innovative industries.",

Along with the academic introductions to the field has come the lesson that such empowering and practically-relevant knowledge should ultimately be disseminated to all – especially the youth – to enable them to make well-informed decisions. Hence, I was prompted to join RED; I hope to support the team’s mission of providing all with easier access to pragmatic neuroscience-based knowledge, such as that pertaining to the effects, functioning and regulation of drugs, through various exciting educational mediums. Further, I hope to facilitate the club’s endeavours, with the rest of the IT team, by helping to overcome all technical challenges, and by ultimately assisting the expansion of its opportunities, and positive influence.",

Ever since elementary school, one of the most important things in my life has been the idea of scientific literacy, and the view that it is not about your level of knowledge, but an overwhelming curiosity towards the world around you. As a result, I believe that it is essential that science is taught in a way that is engaging, interactive, and purposeful. I joined RED with the desire to educate students about the risks of drug use viewed through a scientific lens, and design presentations that would encourage them to apply what they have learned to their own lives. Whenever I have free time, you can usually find me listening to music or trying to learn new obscure hobbies.",

My aim as an Education Coordinator is to continue creating and distributing content that sparks the interest of youth towards the scientific and social implications of drugs in order to allow self-made mature and informed decisions.

Growing up, I was taught about drugs and substance use disorders in a way that scared me. This made me avoid these subject areas because I was afraid. Being at university, studying science, and presenting at RED, has made me realize how essential it is for everyone to have a scientific-based knowledge of drugs and substance use. Understanding and learning through a scientific lens can change one’s perspective in regards to the decisions they make and how they see others. By using science and making the learning process engaging and interactive, I have seen our presentations make kids more open to being educated and less scared of being informed. With RED I want to keep up their desire to learn about these subject areas that are important and prevalent in their society, so that they can make decisions while understanding their consequences.

Drug education and awareness is something that I think is especially important for our generation due to the impact of social media. Drugs and alcohol are always "advertised" on our socials through big celebrities and that may lead to many misconceptions about consumption. Additionally, the popularity of vapes and the legalization of marijuana demands that we as a society look to promote drug education. That is why I think that RED can have a huge impact on our community: by expanding beyond just saying "drugs are bad" and actually explaining some of the science behind drugs, we are able to promote safe consumption and healthy choices. Additionally, as students we may be able to provide a connection that is more impactful. As this year's VP External I hope to continue our steps towards expansion and continue to spread out message to as many schools as possible.`,
