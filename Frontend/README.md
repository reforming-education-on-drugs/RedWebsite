## Getting started

```
npm install
```

## Local development

Developing on MacOSX? Install Homebrew to install watchman to start a local server successfully:  
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" ; brew install watchman
```

Starting the local server:  
```
npm start
```

Please wait for Webpack to bundle and serve all of the project's files and load the development website. In **webpack.config.dev.js**, the development server is configured to open a new window or tab and load the development server. It has also been configured to hot-load the development server with new changes when source files are saved.

## Deployment

```
npm run build
```

This will run Webpack for the production environment, using **webpack.config.prod.js**. It will bundle all ReactJS, HTML, and CSS and export it all into the ``/dist`` directory. Simply copy the entire contents of the ``/dist`` directory and publish it in the production web host directory.
