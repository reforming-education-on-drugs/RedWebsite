Topics such as substance misuse and addiction were explored through interactions among participants and throughout the event. To start off the event, LINKages participants were first asked series of trivia questions regarding biological pathways and the role of neurons. In the latter half, participants learned about familiar drugs and found themselves engaged in an insightful discussion surrounding the legalization of marijuana to conclude the day! All in all, RED received a lot of positive feedback from the participants and hopes to collaborate with LINKages in the near future! A huge shout out to our hardworking RED club volunteers- we cannot thank you enough!"

In terms of the in-class presentations, we were glad to hear about the heightened interest and engagement involving the activities planned and information conveyed by RED. Students were exposed to a variety of material from covering the role of the neurons in the brain to how different substances, such as alcohol, affect an individual‚Äôs behavior. Students also got the opportunity to take part in reaction time tests, engage in a debate surrounding a popular topic, and enjoyed diagnosing ‚Äúpatients‚Äù in our ‚ÄúPatient Overdose Investigation‚Äù activity. Overall, the presentations were an incredible experience and we look forward to the presentations planned in the near future!!"

With the support of the NSA, we hosted a fantastic event which participants seemed to really enjoy. Many learned new things, some tried to diagnose patients while others were too busy being competitive in our reaction-time test. All in all, it was a lot of fun informing the general public about the science of drugs! Stay tuned for more updates!"
