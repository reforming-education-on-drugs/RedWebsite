        <p>All executive positions will be appointed (please see Article 7 for specifications). The term of office shall commence on May 1st and end on April 30th of the following school year. Both executive and general members must provide 2-weeks resignation notice. Resigning executive members are responsible for the transitioning of a new executive member, this new member will be appointed by the co-presidents and remain in office for the remainder of the term.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Any member may be impeached for the following:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mismanagement of finances</li>
            <li>Failure to maintain responsibilities</li>
            <li>Criminal/illicit behaviour (consistent)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Prior to official impeachment, a meeting must be held between the executive member in question and the rest of the executive team. This will serve as an opportunity to address the issues at-hand, and hear reasons from all executive members. If impeachment is pursued, then another executive meeting must be held in order to come to a final decision; this will require a 2/3 majority vote of the sitting executive team (excluding the executive in question).</p>

        <h2>Article 7: Incoming Executives</h2>
        
        <p>Executive positions will be advertised to all club members as they become available. All members will have the equal opportunity to apply for any open executive position.</p>
        
        <ol type="A">
            <li>The election of a new club Executive will take place given a vacancy of said position.</li>
            
            <li>All applicants will be required to submit a resume and statement of intent</li>
            
            <li>All applicants will be interviewed by at least 2 of the sitting executive members</li>
            
            <li>An executive meeting will be held to discuss the qualification of all applicants</li>
            
            <li>A 2/3 majority vote by the executive team will be required to appoint an applicant to the vacant position</li>
            
            <li>Appealing Election Results: The individual behind this movement must present their reasons of appeal before the newly elected and past executive members. This committee of individuals will then vote on whether to disregard the appeal or re-vote for the specified position(s), depending on the reasons and evidence presented.</li>
            
            <li>Proxy votes are allowed, under the following conditions: The member representing the absent member must have the decision (regarding the subject) signed and written by the absentee.</li>
        </ol>


        <h2>Article 8: Transition of the Executive</h2>
        <p>The sitting executives are responsible for teaching the incoming executive(s) on club policies and procedures. The new executive(s) will also be presented with club HUBS as well as custodianship of club records, materials, and bank/financial records. The outgoing executive is responsible for all year-end activities including the submission of the Annual Report to the SU, locker clean-out, and preparing of financial statements.</p>

        <h2>Article 9: Meetings</h2>
        <p>Any executive member may call an emergency meeting, with at least 24 hours notice. There shall be at least one Executive meeting and/or General Meeting per month during the academic year. Presence of 2/3 of Executive members shall constitute quorum. It is the executive duty of both the co-presidents to chair all meetings; however, this can be done individually if one of the co-presidents is not present. In a scenario in which both Co-presidents are unable to attend, any other executive member is expected to take-over. It is the role of Vice President Internal to record meeting minutes, notify club members of meetings and meeting agendas, and to make these records and agendas available to all members. </p>

        <h2>Article 10: Amendments</h2>
        <p>This constitution shall comprise the operating basis of RED. All amendments to this document must be ratified by a two-thirds vote of the club membership. A copy of the amended constitution must be submitted to the Students’ Union within two weeks of ratification</p>
