                <p>I am in my 3rd year of my BSc in Plant Biology with a minor in French. My mission as Co-President of RED is to ensure that Calgary’s younger generation is informed and well-educated, so our whole community can move forward together with respect to substance abuse and STEM programming. I am a firm believer that there is always room for improvement, so I try to keep all members of the club performing at their best and always trying to innovate and improve our presentations and activities. My vision for RED is for it to expand to multiple languages and all learning levels. My interests outside of RED include urban agriculture and working with the elderly.

                <p>I am a third year Bioinformatics student learning computer programming while pursuing my passions in biology. One of the aspects of biology that fascinates me is the brain. It has the capacity to learn, understand and apply. Although today we are still unable to know how the whole brain functions, we have discovered many intresting properties of the brain. At the moment recreational drugs is one of the simplest concepts to learn yet very interesting. It is fascinating to know how the body reacts to these reagents and how we become addicted. In this club I will be ensuring the smooth operation of IT. I hope with this information we can educate teens, so they can make informed decisions.</p>

                <p>Hola, my name is Jose Uriel Perez Alvarez Gutierrez Anota, but you can call me Uriel. I’m a third year Biomedical Sciences student at the University of Calgary who is not only in love with science, but also dedicated to promoting healthy lifestyles. As VP External, I have the task of directly expanding the outreach of RED, using my business and personable skills. In addition to stimulating new ideas for the club, I facilitate the communication between schools, coordinating presentation dates, and target club objectives. Despite having to do the “grown up” duties in the club, my role as VP External exposes me to first hand teaching experiences with individuals passionate about biology and eager to lend their knowledge about the intricate workings of the human body. I’m eager to continue this experience and expand RED’s outreach.

                <p>Hello, my name is Sophie and I am currently completing a combined degree in Business (OBHR) and Psychology. I am the VP of Finance and my main goal is to ensure that our club is well funded and managed to ultimately deliver the most engaging experiences possible for both our audience and our volunteers. RED takes an innovative, scientific approach to re-educating youths about the impact of substance use, which I find to be unlike other traditional drug information programs typically presented in schools. As the management of finances and sponsorships goes a long way towards the long term success of RED, I aim to continuously improve our opportunities in this area. In my free time, I enjoy seeing friends and family, as well as discovering new restaurants to try out and shows to watch!

This will be my second year with RED and I am very excited about my recent transition from Education Coordinator to Director of Education. As VP Education, I ensure our presentations are not only presented in an engaging manor but also packed with the most important and relevant information for adolescences in Calgary. RED’s exciting and non-traditional, science-based approach aids and will continue to aid younger generations in making informed decisions about substance use. In my free time you can find me playing basketball, hiking in the mountains, or volunteering with local organizations.

                <p>At the University of Calgary, I am entering my second year in Kinesiology. I was drawn to RED because of the different approach to drug education. There has been a lot of discussion in the media and in the community regarding drug use, and I am interested in ensuring individuals by creating an understanding of how these agents affect the body. One of the responsibilities of VP internal is to take care of the administrative responsibilities related to organizing and to continue promoting the club to ensure continual success. In my spare time, I enjoy being active in the outdoors and trying restaurants throughout the city with friends and family.

I have always been passionate about student engagement, social justice and continuously intrigued by the thought of spreading and gaining knowledge! Thus, with RED, I plan on growing in the field of neuroscience and hope to educate the early teenage population on substance misuse and its severe consequences by building a strong biological framework around drugs.  As a Junior Executive, I am beyond excited to make RED’s vision widespread across campus and the rest of the community through various media platforms.  In my spare time, you can find me playing sports, watching MasterChef marathons, and traveling!

                <p>Hi, my name is Suman and I am a first-year Kinesiology major. My interest with substance abuse issues began at a young age when I witnessed my peers experimenting with drugs. Over the years, their habits progressed and drugs became a part of their lifestyle. Witnessing first-hand the impact that substance abuse has on youth has driven me to take a stand and educate a younger audience. My goal and purpose on this team is to make sure that the next generation of students get the opportunity to learn about substance abuse in a way that was not made available to me or my peers. Through engaging presentations and interactive learning, I hope to inform the younger generation about the science, and knowledge of drugs and substances. I would also like to introduce the world of science to youth at a younger age as it is one of the fastest-growing and innovative industries. In my spare time, I love to listen to rap music, explore the food options on the Food Network, and craft small artisanal birdhouses</p>

                <p>I am in my fourth year of Computer Science, concentrating my studies in Software Engineering at the University of Calgary. In this area of study, objective understanding of the potential consequences of my actions are vital in making well-informed decisions. However, it is not a requirement to be a critical thinker to make well-informed decisions. Speaking from experience, understanding the foundational basics can largely assist in mitigating several consequences and misunderstandings. I hope this will enable youths to take that first, possibly intimidating, step in trying to understand complex topics - such as the effects of drugs. Through my involvement in RED, I also hope to reflect the team’s passionate efforts in this endeavor, in person and on the website. I also enjoy a good pun and when I have free time, I love to spend it with good company!</p>

                <p>Hello, my name is Slobodan Zelic and I am currently completing my BCOMM degree in Finance. I joined RED because I appreciated their unique approach of educating students on the adverse effects of drug usage. We do so through the means of interactive scientific demonstrations and presentations. RED establishes a foundational understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in drug addiction and the social implications associated.  It is my goal to secure additional funding in order to support and ensure the successful growth of RED.  In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, playing sports, traveling, and volunteering for the Breaking Free Foundation.

                <p>When initially creating RED, our mission was simple: Provide an innovative and unique approach to drug education focused on the fundamentals of physiology and neuroscience as they relate to psychoactive drugs and substances of abuse. From the get-go, the focus was to deliver high-quality, interactive, and engaging presentations that not only resonate with students, but leave them excited and motivated for science-learning moving forward. As RED continues to grow, my goal is to ensure that these values with which RED was founded are maintained, promoted, and sought. </p>
